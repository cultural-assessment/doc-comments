# Cultural Assessment Working Group (DLF)

This sub-group of the DLF Assessment Interest Group (DLF AIG) was formed in February 2016 to discuss ways by which we may assess our digital collections and their cultural impact. Members of the DLF AIG for Cultural Assessment aim to first identify institutional data and practices that may be relevant to building a robust understanding of “cultural assessment.” Then, the group will investigate and attempt to surface underlying assumptions within our data and practices to help the community better understand the social structures that both influence our work and result from it. Ideally, the group will develop helpful and nuanced rubrics for institutional measurement and analysis of cultural biases and assumptions. The DLF AIG Cultural Assessment group intends to raise awareness of cultural bias and institutional “blind spots,” as well as recommend a set of data points, to create more inclusive cultures within DLF member organizations. 
We will explore whether and how cultural biases/assumptions are embedded in: 
materials we have available in physical collections - special collections, institutional archives;
-in librarians’ and archivists’ selections of what to digitize;
-in the requests their patrons and communities make for content;
-in choices about levels of digitization and preservation;
-in metadata-creation/descriptive activities;
-and in decisions about how/when/whether we publicize collections and make them discoverable.
with the understanding that biases and assumptions have concrete impact on digital library collections and services.

## What's here?

What you find here will be project elements that are open for dicussions, commenting and augmentation. We actively solicit feedback on a rolling bases and hope to integrate any alterations and changes twice a year as time/funding provides.

## Projects up for Discussion:

### Annotated Bibliography
The Cultural Assessment Group recently published their first draft of an annotated bibliography reflects research that is helpful for framing the notion of cultural assessment in the cultural heritage sector with a particular focus on digital libraries. Resources include detailed legislation for cultural heritage stewardship, collaborative cross-cultural case studies, and articles focused on the current methods of digital collection creation. We drew much inspiration from the Social Inclusion Audit and the Balanced Value Impact Model among others.
The group is also soliciting feedback and additional resources in the running bibliography, in an attempt to make the resource more broadly applicable (i.e. not solely focused on North America). Any one can add to and comment on the bibliography. We only ask you __do NOT DELETE__ any items.

### Selection Workflow Framework
This DRAFT Selection Workflow Framework document has a twofold purpose: to inform the Internet Archive’s book selection process for its proposed 100&Change MacArthur Foundation project (as part of a DLF/IA partnership on “Inclusive Curation”) and to serve as a resource on best practices for Digital Library Federation member institutions and the broader digital library community.
This document aims to define parts of a digital collection selection workflow for public cultural heritage and academic institutions, in alignment with the mission of the DLF Cultural Assessment working group.
