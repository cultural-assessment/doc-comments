<h1>Selection Workflow Framework</h1>
<h2>DLF Cultural Assessment Working Group<br/>
Selection Task Force<br/>
May/June 2017 DRAFT</h2>
 
<p>This document aims to define parts of a digital collection selection workflow for public cultural heritage and academic institutions, in alignment with the mission of the DLF Cultural Assessment working group. This group was founded in 2016 to: investigate and surface underlying cultural biases and assumptions in digital library data and practices; develop more nuanced rubrics for institutional measurement and analysis; help our community better understand the social structures that both influence our work and result from it; and foster more inclusive practices within DLF member organizations.</p>

<p>This DRAFT Selection Workflow Framework document has a twofold purpose: to inform the Internet Archive’s book selection process for its proposed 100&Change MacArthur Foundation project (as part of a DLF/IA partnership on “Inclusive Curation”) and to serve as a resource on best practices for Digital Library Federation member institutions and the broader digital library community. </p>
 
<h3>Resource Pools</h3>
<p>In order to select materials to digitize, acquire, or license, there must be pools of resources from which to choose. The availability of these pools is required and will affect the selection decision-making process. This includes the selection of single resource to incorporate as part of an established collection. Knowing where to look for resources and understanding the resources available for digitization or incorporation is a learned skill and is subjective. Often, there is a differentiation here between “born-digital” and “materials to digitize”.</p>

<p>Examples: Vendor catalogs, antiquarian websites, artist’s websites, auction house sites, institutional records, publisher catalogs/websites, individuals, community groups, donors, art works, research objects and outputs, individual/group event ephemera</p>

<h4>Questions to ask:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Where are the resources from which to choose?</li>
  <li>Is there collaboration with partner institutions to make resources available? Does the institution have the knowledge, or capacity to develop, skill to accomplish the project alone and/or with a partner?*</li>
  <li>Who owns the rights to these resources? Are they in the public domain?</li>
    <ul>
      <li>How were the original rights to these resources obtained?</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Was it a predatory or exploitative process?</li>
        <li>Should the resources be under the copyright they are currently under? I.E. Should the materials have been repatriated because copyright holder obtained right under questionability ethical practices?</li>
        <li>Does Copyright apply culturally? How is this being mitigated if not?</li>
        </ul>
     </ul>
  <li>What types of resources are they?</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Are they well documented - do you know how they were created / why they were created?</li>
    </ul>
  <li>What are credible or authoritative sources? Are authoritative resources important to your institution?</li>
    <ul>
    <li>What does ‘credible’ or ‘authoritative’ sources mean to the institution?</li>
    </ul>
  <li>If the resources are not readily available, what will it cost to get them? Personnel time? Vendor purchasing? Community stipend?</li>
  <li>Do the materials have established value? Are you anticipating they will become valuable in the future? (Value defined broadly, including but not limited to diverse perspectives, curricular value, monetary value, community-defined value)</li>
  <li>Does the organization collect particular types of content and does it have a preservation commitment to particular content?</li>
  <li>What is the current state of “Fair Use” and “Fair Dealing”?</li>
  <li>In what language is the resource available? Is this an obstacle?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Awareness of Resources</h3>
<p>Building awareness of resources is key to being able to select them for digitization or acquisition. In many cases, selection is not accomplished by one individual, but is a discussion or cooperative effort among a group, staff, or cohort. Many institutions also learn from community members, funders, and/or specialist librarians, who become aware of resources that they believe an institution should acquire, reformat, or obtain. </p>

<p>Examples: automatically generated lists from websites, subscriptions of catalogs through the mail, email inquiries, outreach/community events, workshops, online searching of websites, social media, meetings</p>
<h4>Questions to ask:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Where are you looking for resources and how are you informed?</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Are the resources already digitized?</li>
      <li>Will the resources require digitization?</li>
     </ul>
   <li>Are readily available resources the best match for your needs? Do they preference the status quo?</li>
   <li>Where are the resource pools that would fulfill your strategic priorities and mission/vision?</li>
     <ul>
      <li>Who are you involving in the process of conducting environmental scan of resources available? Is it a diverse group? Does it include people that may be impacted by the resource?</li>
     </ul>
   <li>What are the “preferred vendors” and is there a reason? Is that decision preferencing a certain perspective, demographic, or worldview?</li>
   <li>Will community members be part of the processes of identification and selection?</li>
      <ul>
       <li>Is there a need to establish/develop community relationships?</li>
      </ul>
    <li>What modes of communication / outreach / engagement will be used?</li>
  </ul>
    
 
<h3>Identification of Resource/Need</h3>
<p>When evaluating pools of resources, certain resources are identified and may be shared and discussed. Institutions may also accept resource requests from patrons, community members, funding organizations, content or subject specialists. The selection of some types of resources are mandated by institutional policies or statutes, and are therefore more easily identified. In some organizations, anyone can identify resources to select, and in other organizations, this process is limited to certain Curators.</p>
 
   <h4>Questions to ask:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Are you under contract to maintain certain resources?</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Why must you select these resources? Beyond “Because they said so”</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Are certain types of resources prefered and why?</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Are items selected around themes? (How often) Do these themes change?</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Are there preferred authors or types of authors?</li>
  <li>Are there certain subjects/topics emphasized or missing and why?</li>
    <ul>
      <li>How are these gaps determined?</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Do the resources adhere to the organization’s existing collections, priorities, and/or areas of strategic emphasis?</li>
  <li>Does the organization have a preservation commitment to various types of content or formats?</li>
  <li>Does the organization have staff expertise, workflows, and/or technical infrastructure to properly handle, manage, and preserve the content or format?</li>
  <li>Is this information conveyed in a web form or other method? What information is required and how is it described?</li>
  <li>Will experts attest to the importance of the collection?*</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Who are these experts?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>How do they represent a diverse set of concerns and perspectives?</li>
        </ul>
     </ul>
   <li>What (if any) restrictions will be made of the resource availability?</li>
 </ul>
 
<h3>Proposing of Possible Resource with Decision-makers</h3>
<p>Sharing and discussion of possible resources that have been identified with individuals, groups, or committees who have selection responsibilities and/or are authorized to make decisions. Often these are senior administration, department heads, special collections staff, digitization specialists, and archives staff. The resources may be communicated via a project proposal form, list, or reporting tool. </p>
 
    <h4>Questions to ask:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>What information is shared or communicated through a proposal process? Is it enough information for the decision-makers to come to a decision? (see above)</li>
  <li>How is the proposal information shared or communicated? Does that preference certain modes of learning, ways of knowing, or communication styles?</li>
  <li>What is the perceived importance of the material? Are multiple voices/perspectives considered?</li>
  <li>Is discussion open to a wider group/forum?</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Are decision-makers representatives of a cultural group or organization?</li>
      <li>How is the cultural group defined or identified?</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Does the organization have funding to properly digitize and/or manage this content over time?</li>
  <li>What is the feedback mechanism for possible resource? With whom is the feedback communicated? Does that preference certain communities, modes of learning, ways of knowing, or communication styles?</li>
 
<h3>“Test fit” against priorities and policies</h3>
<p>An individual or group with selection responsibilities compares selected resources to existing institutional/organizational priorities and collection development, digitization, or other relevant policies.</p>
<p>Often groups/committees develop policies and criteria against which selected resources are measured. These may be formal written documentation or not written down/informal.</p>
 
<h4>Criteria for selecting resources may include:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Preservation reason (materials crumbling, brittle, ink is fading, obsolete media, want to avoid further damage to materials, etc.)</li>
  <li>Access reason (limited access to necessary playback equipment, unique collection held by single institution, e.g. theses & dissertations, special collections)</li>
  <li>Use in some digital project (including those funded by grants)</li>
  <li>Patron request (could be all or none of the above)</li>
  <li>Perceived importance of the resource (broad appeal, to surface a “hidden” collection, fills a collection gap, curricular request)</li>
  <li>Relationship with current or potential donor</li>
  <li>Representation of a cultural group or community of people</li>
  <li>Resources needed to accomplish the project (e.g. funding, metadata creation, digitization, preservation/conservation/forensics, logistics of moving/reformatting/working with the item)</li>
  <li>Grants</li>
  <li>Relevant Themes / Events</li>
</ul>
 
<h4>Questions to ask:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Who writes your policies and how often are they reviewed?</li>
  <li>Are your policies preferencing particular views and why?</li>
  <li>Are your policies reviewed and/or edited by a diverse group? </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Does the group involve the people of whom the digital material represents?</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Are these resources aligned with institutional priorities?</li>
    <ul>
      <li>How often do these priorities change/ reviewed?</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Do selection guidelines and practices (see above) include historically marginalized communities?</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Are you following appropriate litigation regarding materials? EX NAGPRA for Native People’s material</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Who are you collecting for and what do they need?</li>
  <li>Will resources conform to ADA and web accessibility standards and be made maximally accessible for patrons/community members with disabilities?</li>
  <li>Does the resource require a special workflow, technique, handling, or description? Is this requirement and follow-through documented?</li>
  <li>What are the minimum disciplinary standards for acquiring and managing the items and is your institution prepared to accommodate them?</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Are these minimum disciplinary standards applied relatively evenly across collection/materials? Across institution?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>What collections are privileged and why? (as it relates to the proposed resource)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
<ul>
 
<h4>Decision-making</h4>
<p>Selection requires an individual or group with authority to make final decisions. This is often the point at which a copyright review is performed and staffing resources and capacity are considered. Often the final decision is made by someone who is senior or holds highest authority within an organizational unit. Alternately, selections may be “automatic” and employ algorithms or patron use to make decisions about what to select (e.g. patron-driven or evidence-based acquisition processes). </p>
 
    <h4>Questions to ask:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Who decides and why? </li>
  <li>Is the evaluation process clearly defined?</li>
  <li>Who writes and how are your algorithms written? What are the criteria used and why?</li>
  <li>How does this new resource shape your collection(s)?</li>
  <li>How does this relate to your target audiences? What are the scenarios for use?</li>
    <ul>
      <li>What User Personas are you using to create these scenarios?</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Can the selected resources be handled by internal staff and with current capacity or should the work be contracted with an external vendor?</li>
    <ul>
      <li>What restrictions does the vendor impose on the resource?</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Does the resource have existing metadata or does it need to be created? Who will create it and are there resources available to accomplish this? What are the appropriate vocabularies and schemas needed?</li>
  <li>What is the priority order for the project and how does that relate to your community’s needs?</li>
  <li>Does the organization have a dissemination strategy and/or user access plan and do the proposed resources fit that plan? </li>
  <li>Has this item been reviewed for copyright and other intellectual property rights?</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Are you willing to pursue the copyright to make the collection more representative of a larger collection? Of demographics? Why / not?</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
 
<h3>Acting on Decision</h3>
<p>After the selection decision, someone or some mechanism will take steps to acquire, digitize, license, or otherwise make the resource a part of the institutional/organizational collections. Often, these actions need to be prioritized and sent to a specialized workflow. For instance, a digitization request, once approved, may be routed through a special collections workflow to ensure appropriate preservation measures.</p>
 
    <h4>Questions to ask:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>What is prioritized for acquisition and why?</li>
  <li>Who decides (an why?) and are the decisions documented?</li>
  <li>What were the final points of the discussion regarding what to select?</li>
  <li>If an intellectual property rights review was needed, what are the results of that review and does that affect which workflow is used?</li>
  <li>What stakeholders are being consulted as the resource is being finalized for inclusion?</li>
  <li>Are resources being cut/added due to more detailed scrutiny of collection? Why?</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Does this processes require the inclusion of additional or the exclusion of established stakeholders? What makes this necessary?</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
 
<h3>Sharing/Communicating Decisions</h3>
<p>The decisions are often sent to a wider group than the decision-makers in order to accomplish projects and communicate priorities. </p>
 
<h4>Questions to ask:</h4><ul>
  <li>Are these decisions documented and do they include notes on the justifications?</li>
  <li>Is the decision process well documented, and is it clear how one can become part of the process? </li>
  <li>Where are the decisions documented? Are they shared within your institution, and/or made public? Why/not?</li>
  <li>Who is made aware of the decision documentation?</li>
  <li>Is there a mechanism for feedback?</li>
  <li>Will there be alterations to decisions based on feedback? Why /not?</li>
</ul>
 
<h3>Documenting Selection Decisions</h3>
d<p>Document decisions about what is selected for acquisition in a place where people (as defined by the organization) can view it and refer to it. Some institutions do not share the results of their selection decisions.</p>
 
<h4>Examples:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Final project and grant proposals that include scope, reasoning, time frame, defined outcomes, intellectual property rights decisions, documented approvals, and resources needed</li>
  <li>Documentation of the evaluation, including questions and answers from the evaluators</li>
  <li>Annotated selection criteria list, with documentation of information gathered for each criterion</li>
  <li>If digitization is required, a list of physical/source objects with anticipated methods of transfer or routing and storage during the project</li>
  <li>A “success statement” that indicates metrics for success</li>
  <li>Item tracking worksheet (a comprehensive, detailed inventory identifying all physical objects, locations, and eventual disposition)</li>
  <li>Web page or report describing the objects or collections selected</li>
  <li>Record of feedback co-located with project proposal and/or decisions documentation</li>
</ul>
 
<h4>Questions to ask:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Is this documentation publically accessible? If not, why not?</li>
  <li>Do the original, intended, and future stakeholders have access to said documentation? For how long will access be maintained?</li>
  <li>Are these decisions dated?</li>
  <li>Is there an anticipated review of resource? Is this documented?</li>
</ul>
 
 
<h2>Text Analysis of DLF CA Selection Workflow Submissions</h2>
<h3>A Summary</h3>

<h4>Goals/Objectives</h4>
 
<p>The Internet Archive proposal is to bring 4 million of the most beloved and important books to learners by helping all libraries become digital libraries. The 100&Change vision includes collaborating with Digital Library Federation librarians on the Inclusive Curation Project to select four million books to scan. Our goal is to design a community-responsive, transparent form of book selection that can ultimately serve as a model for creating more diverse and democratized digital collections everywhere.</p>

<p>The DLF Cultural Assessment group conducted an open survey requesting digital selection workflows (graphic and text description) with an emphasis on archives, libraries and museums.</p>

<ul>Institutional Attributes
 
<li>13 Responses</li>
<li>12 Academic Libraries</li>
<li>Largest = 34,000 students</li>
<li>Smallest = 1,500 students</li>
<li>1 Public Library</li>
<li>0 Museum</li>
<li>12 = U.S. institutions</li>
<li>1 = Brazil institution</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The initial draft of the Selection Workflow Framework was generated using the above demographic. We recognize that there are gaps in the cultural heritage institution representation and moved forward with what we had. We will strongly encourage feedback from missing sectors, as we have throughout the processes. The group will attempt to directly target specific institutions/people if a general call is unsuccessful with particular focus on public libraries, museums and smaller historical societies.</p>

<h4>Questions that arose and Observations during analysis:</h4>
<p>Most people answered the questionnaire as if they were digitizing collections -- selection has already happened?<p>
<p>No Museums responded - all initial respondents are libraries (might be because of our heavy focus on libraries/archives in the call out to specified listservs with which the group participants are connected).</p>
<p>There’s a lot of format and preservation criteria, and not about whether one thing is more important than others or why it’s necessary to select.</p>
<p>Which groups have documentation - collection policies are governing decision making - people. Who decide what gets digitized/selected?</p>
<p>How does the selection for digitization relate to the institutional repository currently, and in the future?  </p>
<p>Were we asking the right questions?</p>
<p>Do we need a section where we get specific about the position titles of those making the recommendations and who is making the decisions? Or perhaps our sample is not big enough to do this effectively? </p>

<h4>Analysis</h4>
 
<p>Institutions that identified the depositor (donor, curator, other) or mechanism for selection: </p>
 
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Selection and digitization submissions originate from a mix of donors or internal library staff, not by designated selection committees. </p>
 
<p>“We moved from a committee who would review proposals from curators and assess based on certain criteria (preservation, scholarship, etc.) to being proactive.”</p>
<p>“We have a standing Digitization Prioritization Committee with membership from the digital libraries, the archives & special collections library, and collection development. The committee meets once a month to consider requests submitted by members of the university community, both inside and outside the libraries.”</p>
<p>“For organizations where we are their repository of record, the Curator coordinates with the organization to find out what digital content they have. Alternatively, potential donors contact us and the Curator discusses their digital content with them. The Curator consults with staff about the feasibility of collecting and preserving the content.”</p>
<p>“The bulk of our digitization takes place through planned projects, sometimes with grants. These are generally proposed and directed by our staff.”</p>
<p>“Donor contacts Special Collections & Archives (SCA) and/or SCA contacts campus partner for inter-university transfer. SCA does very little active solicitation of donations.”</p>
<p>“A Unit Digitization Plan is mandated for all collecting units and is updated every three years (minimum). It includes the scope of what we intend to digitize, our priorities, the policies and standards we follow, and estimates of our current and future capacity for digitization.” </p>
<p>“Several librarians, including the collection development coordinator, digital projects coordinator, and liaisons, keep a lookout for documents...”</p>
<p>“Many of our digital collections currently are a response to external pressures rather than being initiated from within the Libraries at this point, largely due to funding constraints.”</p>
<p><em>Outlier:</em> “We are now on a yearly cycle where we interview each curator, gather their top wishes for digital projects, and match that to our capacity for the year...This capacity is 60% of our available time. We leave 40% of our time for unscheduled projects throughout the year. We use broad categories of Metdata [sic], Digitization, and Project Management, to assess our capacity.“</p>
<p>Are decisions based on published/public policies?</p>
 
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The majority of institutions are not relying on codified, published policies that govern selection.  </p>
 
<p>“Criteria on which projects are judged usually focus heavily on condition of the material, copyright concerns, and quality of available metadata. We don't have a digital archivist and very rarely work with born-digital materials.”</p>
<p>“Criteria for selection are based on our Collection Development policy.” These are rarely made public.</p>
<p>“Selection process to ensure collections align with campus teaching, learning and research needs and our ability to provide long-term access and support."</p>
<p>“Relationship to Other Digital Collections: it is important to contribute to “critical mass” of digital collections in the subject whenever possible. By complementing existing online collections, the value of the collection will enhance the subject area and the user experience.”</p>
 
<p>Are decisions based on required resources (space, staff, format)?</p>
 
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> A majority of institutions prioritize decisions based on staff or space capacity, not on collecting priority. Most consider the institution’s collection strengths and importance of the materials prior to accepting new materials.</p>
 
<p>“We use broad categories of Metadata, Digitization, and Project Management, to assess our capacity.”  </p>
<p>“Criteria for digitization include: a. the perceived importance of the materials: we try to digitize those materials that we perceive to have broad appeal; or where we think providing access would bring hidden collections to light; or where there is a need for access expressed through an academic course at our college. b. the state of the materials: if they are in poor condition or if they are on obsolete media, we may prioritize these materials for digitization. c. our ability to provide access to the materials: some of our materials are brittle and we prefer to provide access through surrogates; some of our materials are on obsolete media or we do not have regular access to playback equipment, so we prefer to provide access through digital surrogates. d. our ability to digitize materials in-house: given our funding and staffing, we have prioritized the do-it- yourself digitization projects over ones requiring external equipment and expertise.”</p>
<p>“Housing/space issues: can we in good conscience commit to preserving this collection?”</p>
<p>“Access issues: do we have the equipment to digitize or make available the media being donated? If not, is there potential funding to outsource digitization?”</p>
<p>“No matter how important the collection, it must be organized and described before it is ready for distribution: organized, processed, metadata assigned, finding aid created.”</p>
<p>“Do the Libraries have the knowledge, or the capacity to develop, skills to accomplish the project alone and/or with a partner? Ample staff to bring the project to fruition or the ability to hire such staff.“</p>
<p>“Broad priorities are roughly based on format, which in turn is based on existing collections strengths and in-house digitization technical capacity.”</p>
<p>“Items/collections that come with their own (usually external grant) funding are prioritized over those that don’t.” </p>
<p>“The criteria for choosing to proceed with including or digitizing a requested item/collection have to do with our infrastructure and capacity to do so rather than a philosophical reason to preserve or promote access to the materials.”</p>
 
<p>Does an individual or committee make the final decision?</p>
 
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> A majority of respondents indicate that selection and digitization decisions are made by individuals, not by appointed committees. </p>
 
<p>“The matching of projects to capacity happens by the Director of all the curators and the AUL for Collections.”</p>
<p>“A member or members of Special Collections and Archives (SCA) review the request. Typically whichever staff member is contacted first will bring in the other two full-time staff of SCA to discuss, but sometimes a single staff member will determine suitability of collection for accessioning.”</p>
<p>“We moved from a committee who would review proposals from curators and assess based on certain criteria (preservation, scholarship, etc.) to being proactive.”</p>
<p>“Requests are routed to the Assistant Deans for Distinctive Collections and Digital Initiatives & Discovery Services to determine feasibility.”</p>
 
<p<Is the selection process based on any specific priorities?</p>
 
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Selections are prioritized by appraised value, fragility or rarity of materials, and materials that are already part of the institution’s collections, and most institutions are not actively seeking new materials. Many collection agendas are dictated by Collection Development Policies that reflect physical collections and do not stand on their own as born-digital or digital only collection policies - the decision process for selection is either not documented more granularly than at the institution level, or we need to specify more granular selection practices.</p>
 
<p>“Selected content in collections we own that are in the public domain because of their uniqueness – won’t find them on Google, Hathi Trust, or anywhere else.”</p>
<p>“Appraisal value – we have made it a policy to digitize all or portions of collections which have been appraised. Part of this is for security purposes and others is for access to the content itself.”</p>
<p>“We have also made it a policy to scan fragile photographic content, such as glass plate negatives, since we prefer researchers not handle the originals.”</p>
<p>“While we have a published Collection Development policy, we do not have written guidelines for how we select and accession collections.”</p>
 
<p>Only one institution had published selection standards, see http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/digital/about/policies/selection.html?mswitch-redir=classic.  </p>
